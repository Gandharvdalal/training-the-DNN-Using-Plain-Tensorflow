# training-the-DNN-Using-Plain-Tensorflow
training the DNN Using Plain Tensorflow,we are using mnist data set which is a tensorflow in built  data set.\


Know more about the data site using the following link-

Using dnn classifier we are achieving over 98 % accuracy rate

we can also use sklearn to fetch data.But tensorflow makes it simpler to perform various task with data set easier(ex-shuffling,regularizing etc)
